## Description

**How does it work 💻**
>
> Using this app is very simple – just scroll down and click one of the links to a demo or repo, downloaded directly from my repository and the repositories of people I've collaborated with. This way, you can see what I've created so far, and the list is always up to date. You can also contact me via the links to my email and social media. You can apply dark mode using the button at the top.

**Methods and aims 🧐**
>
> This app contains all my individual projects and those I contributed to in other repositories. This way, you don't have to search for them elsewhere; you can access each one via a demo or repo link. It is intended to support my CV and works as my portfolio.
>
**How it's built ⚒️**
>
> This application has only one page, and it's very simple and clear. Only the portfolio element changes depending on whether projects can be downloaded from the repositories. There are several links, such as Gmail links addressed directly to me and icons for my social media.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
